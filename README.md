# Devstral Engineer v2 üêã

## Overview

Devstral Engineer v2 is a powerful AI-powered coding assistant that provides an interactive terminal interface for seamless code development. It integrates with Devstral's advanced reasoning models to offer intelligent file operations, code analysis, and development assistance through natural conversation and function calling.

## üöÄ Latest Update: Function Calling Architecture

**Version 2.0** introduces a big upgrade from structured JSON output to native function calling, providing:
- **Natural conversations** with the AI without rigid response formats
- **Automatic file operations** through intelligent function calls
- **Real-time reasoning visibility** with Chain of Thought (CoT) capabilities
- **Enhanced reliability** and better error handling

## Key Features

### üß† **AI Capabilities**
- **Elite Software Engineering**: Decades of experience across all programming domains
- **Chain of Thought Reasoning**: Visible thought process before providing solutions
- **Code Analysis & Discussion**: Expert-level insights and optimization suggestions
- **Intelligent Problem Solving**: Automatic file reading and context understanding
- **Built-in Web Search**: Fetch DuckDuckGo results on demand with `/search` or `/deep-research`

### üõ†Ô∏è **Function Calling Tools**
The AI can automatically execute these operations when needed:

#### `read_file(file_path: str)`

- Batch read multiple files efficiently
- Formatted output with clear file separators

#### `view(file_path: str, offset: int, limit: int)`
- Display part of a file starting at `offset` showing up to `limit` lines
- For very large files a short summary is appended

#### `create_file(file_path: str, content: str)`
- Create new files or overwrite existing ones
- Automatic directory creation and safety checks

#### `create_multiple_files(files: List[Dict])`

- Perfect for scaffolding projects or creating related files

#### `edit_file(file_path: str, original_snippet: str, new_snippet: str)`
- Precise snippet-based file editing
- Safe replacement with exact matching
#### `list_directory(path: str)`
- List files in a directory
#### `create_directory(dir_path: str)`
- Create directories recursively
#### `run_bash(command: str, timeout_ms: int)`
- Execute safe shell commands
#### `tree_view(path: str, depth: int)`
- Display a directory tree
#### `run_tests(test_path: str, options: str)`
- Run project tests via pytest
#### `linter_checker(path: str, linter_command: str)`
- Run a code linter like ruff
#### `formatter(path: str, formatter_command: str)`
- Run a code formatter like black
#### `grep(pattern: str, file_path: str, ignore_case: bool)`
- Search for a regex pattern within a file and return matching lines
#### `glob(pattern: str, cwd: str)`
- List files matching a glob pattern
#### `summarize_code(file_path: str)`
- Summarize a large code file for quick context
#### `git_status()` / `git_diff(path: str)` / `git_log(n: int)` / `git_add(path: str)`
- Interact with git to inspect and stage changes
#### `run_build(command: str)`
- Trigger project build systems
#### `manage_dependency(action: str, package: str)`
- Install or uninstall dependencies via pip

### üìÅ **File Operations**

#### **Automatic File Reading (Recommended)**
The AI can automatically read files you mention:
```
You> Can you review the main.py file and suggest improvements?
‚Üí AI automatically calls read_file("main.py")

You> Look at src/utils.py and tests/test_utils.py
‚Üí AI automatically calls read_multiple_files(["src/utils.py", "tests/test_utils.py"])
```

#### **Manual Context Addition (Optional)**
For when you want to preload files into conversation context:
- **`/add path/to/file`** - Include single file in conversation context
- **`/add path/to/folder`** - Include entire directory (with smart filtering)
- **`/undo`** - Undo the last file change (`/undo N` for multiple steps)
- **`/search your query`** - Fetch DuckDuckGo results and add them as context
- **`/deep-research your query`** - Fetch articles for multi-page research

**Note**: The `/add` command is mainly useful when you want to provide extra context upfront. The AI can read files automatically via function calls whenever needed during the conversation.

### üé® **Rich Terminal Interface**
- **Color-coded feedback** (green for success, red for errors, yellow for warnings)
- **Real-time streaming** with visible reasoning process
- **Structured tables** for diff previews
- **Progress indicators** for long operations

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security & Safety**
- **Path normalization** and validation
- **Directory traversal protection**
- **File size limits** (5MB per file)
- **Binary file detection** and exclusion

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **OpenRouter API Key**: Get your API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)
2. **Python 3.11+**: Required for optimal performance

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd devstral-engineer
   ```

You> Can you read the main.py file and create a test file for it?

üí≠ Reasoning: I need to first read the main.py file to understand its structure...

ü§ñ Assistant> I'll read the main.py file first to understand its structure.
‚ö° Executing 1 function call(s)...
‚Üí read_file
‚úì Read file 'main.py'

```

#### **Automatic Multi-File Analysis**
```
You> Compare the implementation in utils.py with the tests in test_utils.py

üí≠ Reasoning: I need to read both files to compare them...

ü§ñ Assistant> I'll read both files to analyze the implementation and tests.
‚ö° Executing 1 function call(s)...
‚Üí read_multiple_files
‚úì Read files: utils.py, test_utils.py

‚úì Added folder 'src/' to conversation.
üìÅ Added files: (15 files)
  üìÑ src/utils.py
  üìÑ src/models.py
  ...

## File Operations Comparison

| Method | When to Use | How It Works |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Automatic Reading** | Most cases - just mention files | AI automatically calls `read_file()` when you reference files |
| **`/add` Command** | Preload context, bulk operations | Manually adds files to conversation context upfront |

**Recommendation**: Use natural conversation - the AI will automatically read files as needed. Use `/add` only when you want to provide extra context upfront.

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**API Key Not Found**
```bash
# Ensure ~/.config/devstral-engineer/config.yaml contains your key
cat ~/.config/devstral-engineer/config.yaml
```

**Import Errors**
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync  # or pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**File Permission Errors**
- Ensure you have write permissions in the working directory
- Check file paths are correct and accessible

## Contributing

This is an experimental project showcasing Devstral reasoning model capabilities. Contributions are welcome!

### **Development Setup**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd devstral-engineer
uv venv
uv sync
```

### **Run**
```bash
# Preferred way using uv
uv run -m devstral_cli
```
or
```bash
devstral
```

### Debug Profiling
Run with `--debug` to see timing information for context management:
```bash
uv run -m devstral_cli --debug
```
Sample output on a 50 message history showed `_manage_context_window` averaging
around 6ms per call while `trim_conversation_history` completed in under
10ms. Optimization isn't currently necessary.
